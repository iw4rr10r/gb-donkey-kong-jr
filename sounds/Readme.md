# Sound effects

I had managed to find some nice sounds in WAV format for the sound effects of the game...  
But I finally decided not to use them, because reading such sounds at runtime consumes too much CPU.

So I preferred to use procedural sounds, which I set up with the [Valden utility][GSFX GUI].  
And I would like to take this opportunity to thank him, because his little utility really made my job easier.
